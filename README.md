# Excel-Exporter
An exporter for generating github compatible files from excel files.

## Notes

I have been looking for something that I could run on my vba/excel projects to keep track of changes in both the worksheets and the VBA backend. As I work with the VBA code, the displayed values _and_ the formulas, I need something to track all of it. Here it is!
